Hi, my name's Santiago and I'm a ExperimentalNeutrino Physics PhD student at the APC laboratory in Paris . As well as my physics background I also have experience making ML software and data analysis. I am working with KM3NeT, in an international neutrino experiment gaining teamwork and leadership skills.
